This website keeps track of a (fake) tree initiative for Walmart. For every eco-friendly item purchased online or in stores
Walmart promises to plant a tree. The website is designed to allow the company and customers to keep track of the number of
trees that Walmart has planted through this promotion. Through the visual I am hoping to encourage customers to purchase
eco-friendly produces in order to help fill the tree in. Underneath the visual I have attached links to produces that 
would be participating this promotion. These easy access links would encourage customers to buy the items. Not only would
a tree be planted but a customer who typically purchases non-enviormentally friendly goods might be more insentives to switch.
